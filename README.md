# Definitive-3D-project

In this repository we can find a program named Points.py wich help us to scheme how a 3D motor works. Then we use Points.py to draw a 3D rectangle with Rectangle.py. Afterwards we use Rectangle to know how to calculate the lower right corner from a cube inside Cube.py. Finally we use Cube.py to draw 64 cubes to create a Chess with Chess.py.
